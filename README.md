# Block Invaders
## An example game created to demonstrate the use of my [ECS_Library][lib_url]

Block invaders is a pure ECS approximation of Space Invaders, using SDL2 for input and rendering.

## Gameplay
- Defeat the alien horde before it can reach your ship
- Earn bonus points by shooting the intermittent red invaders
- Grab the yellow laser cannon powerups to assist in your battle
- Power through 5 riveting stages in your quest to save the solar system!

## Installation
Uses CMake. Should fetch build dependencies automatically. If on linux, run this script.
```sh
$ bash build_and_run.sh
```
If on windows, use your C++ development tools to build via CMake

## Dependencies
- [ECS_Library][lib_url] - An opinionated ECS library
- [SDL2][sdl_url]
- [SDL TTF][sdl_ttf_url]
- [CMAKE][cmake_url]
